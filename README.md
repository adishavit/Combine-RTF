This test.py file is to combine all rtf files under the same directory into one.

This file could be put in the same document of rtf and run.

Arguments in test.py:

`filedir`: directory of the file containing all rtfs needed to be combined

`filename`: the name of final combined rtf document. The outcome file will be saved under the document named 'outcome'.
The name could be a directory.
In this case, the outcome file will be saved in this directory.

`pagedelimit`: determine if rtf would start in a new page or new line.
`True` when a rtf will start in a new page, `False` when a rtf will start in a new line.
